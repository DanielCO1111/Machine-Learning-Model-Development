# Machine-Learning-Model-Development
This project demonstrates the implementation and application of foundational machine learning algorithms using Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The notebooks include hands-on solutions for real-world classification and clustering tasks such as university admissions prediction and digit recognition.

## Logistic Regression

The Logistic Regression part divided into two main parts:
1. *Part 1: Neural Network using NumPy*  
2. *Part 2: Neural Network in PyTorch* 

The goal is to implement and analyze neural network models first from scratch in NumPy, then using PyTorch.

### Key Features
- Comprehensive Data Analysis: Detailed exploration and manipulation of datasets to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
- Predictive Modeling: Introduction to building and refining predictive models using advanced statistical methods.
- Interactive Visualizations: Leveraging Python's visualization libraries to create interactive plots that effectively communicate the results of data analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Techniques for handling missing data, anomalies, and extracting relevant features for analysis.

## Neural Network and KNN

The Neural Network and KNN part divided into two main parts:

1. *Feedforward Neural Network using NumPy:*
   
- Implement and analyze a simple neural network for classification from scratch using NumPy.

2. *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:*
   
- Apply and evaluate the KNN algorithm for supervised classification, including parameter selection and model assessment.

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with two classic classification algorithms—neural networks (implemented from the ground up) and KNN—comparing their effectiveness on different datasets.

### Key Features

1. Custom Model Implementation: Build neural networks and KNN classifiers from first principles.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with neural network architecture and KNN's 'K' value to optimize accuracy.

3. Comprehensive Evaluation: Visualize decision boundaries and model predictions using Matplotlib.

### Data Preparation
Includes steps for data normalization, feature selection, and handling of training/test splits to ensure fair algorithm comparison.

### Performance Visualization & Analysis
- Interactive plots for loss, accuracy, and decision surfaces.

- Discussion on strengths and weaknesses of neural networks vs. KNN.
