# Machine-Learning-Model-Development
This project demonstrates the implementation and application of foundational machine learning algorithms using Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The notebooks include hands-on solutions for real-world classification and clustering tasks such as university admissions prediction and digit recognition.

## Logistic Regression

The Logistic Regression part divided into two main parts:
1. *Part 1: Neural Network using NumPy*  
2. *Part 2: Neural Network in PyTorch* 

The goal is to implement and analyze neural network models first from scratch in NumPy, then using PyTorch.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive Data Analysis: Detailed exploration and manipulation of datasets to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
- Predictive Modeling: Introduction to building and refining predictive models using advanced statistical methods.
- Interactive Visualizations: Leveraging Python's visualization libraries to create interactive plots that effectively communicate the results of data analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Techniques for handling missing data, anomalies, and extracting relevant features for analysis.

### Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization
- Application of statistical tests to determine significant differences and correlations within the data. 
- Advanced visualization techniques to create dynamic plots and charts for an impactful presentation of data insights.
